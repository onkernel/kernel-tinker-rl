"""
System prompts for computer use agents.

Provides utilities for building system prompts with embedded tool definitions
in Qwen3-VL's native pre-training format.

Format overview:
- Tool definitions embedded in system prompt within <tools></tools> XML tags
- Model outputs: "Action: <description>\\n<tool_call>{...}</tool_call>"
- Uses normalized 0-999 coordinate space (not pixels)

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
{tools_xml}

For each function call, return a JSON object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}}
</tool_call>

# Response format

Response format:
1) Action: a short imperative describing what to do in the UI.
2) A single <tool_call>...</tool_call> block containing only the JSON.

Rules:
- Output exactly in the order: Action, then <tool_call>.
- Be brief: one sentence for Action.
- Do not output anything else outside those parts.

- If coordinates are relative (0-999), map them to the visual element positions in the screenshot.
